## **TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**

#### Test-driven development
**Test-driven development** is all about writing tests before writing any production code. It allows the developer to get instant feedback on the code written, something that's extremely valuable when programming.

Test-driven development cycle:

There are several advantages to TDD:
- Code is written such that it solves the problem at hand – no unnecessary code
- Control pacing of writing code – make it as difficult as you want
- Tests are based on requirements and not code written
- Code is testable from the beginning
- Instant feedback on the written code
- Feedback on the design of the system

TDD should be used when the knowledge on how to design part of a system is lacking or the developer is dealing with a complex problem but should not be used when the problem is familiar and there's nothing to be 'learned or explored'.
